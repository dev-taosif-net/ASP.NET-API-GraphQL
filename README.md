# GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It was developed by Facebook and released as an open-source project in 2015. GraphQL provides a more flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs.

 - Clients ask exactly for the data they need.
 - All data is accessed through one URL, unlike REST which uses multiple endpoints.
 - The schema defines what queries are allowed and what types of data exist.
 - The client controls the shape and structure of the response.
